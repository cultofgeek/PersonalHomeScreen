PersonalHomeScreen
==================

A basic home screen you can use for your browser. It's like a personal portal page that cleanly displays all of your favorite links with no clutter.

I uploaded this project, because I had many people ask me what I had on my screen over the years. And this basic HTML page was the answer. It allowed me to upload this to my webserver and always have access to my links. I have found over the years that I still prefer this view to those offered by Chrome or Safari's personal home view or recently browsed pages. 

This is a stripped down version of what I use for my own personal needs, but should be suitable for whoever may want it. Honestly, it's just an HTML page with some javascript. Use it as you see fit.
