PersonalHomeScreen
==================

A basic home screen you can use as your browser's home page. It's essentially a personal portal page that cleanly displays all of your favorite links all in one place.

I uploaded this project, because I had many people ask me what I had on my screen over the years. And this basic HTML page was the answer.

This is a stripped down version of what I use for my own personal needs, but should be suitable for whoever may want it. Honestly, it's just an HTML page with some javascript. Use it as you see fit.  I have found over the years that I prefer this view to those offered by Chrome or Safari's personal home page or recently browsed pages.
